The model used for predicting the survival rate in this Shiny App calculates the probability of passenger survival based on their sex, class of travel, title, travelling with a family or not, age and which port they departed from. A **Random Forest** was used to create the model.  

The model was created offline and stored in an RDS file which is then read in during the loading of the App. This speeds up the web page load since the generation of the model can take some time and processing resources.

This model has an accuracy of approximately 0.77 (which is not great but for the purposes of this Shiny App demonstration, it will suffice.)
