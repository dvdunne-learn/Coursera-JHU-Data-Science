This Shiny App is part of the project for the Coursera Developing Data Products course from John Hopkins University.

The App uses the Titanic dataset which includes various attributes for the passengers on this ill-fated voyage including whether a person survived or not. 

The App can be used to explore the data or to predict the probability of survival given some parameters.

### How To Use

To start playing with the data, click on the **Explore** tab to visualize some of the data or click on the **Predict** tab to see the chances of survival based on various parameters such as age or class.

Or review the actual data by clicking on the **Data** tab.
