# Developing Data Products Project - Help

## Introduction

This Shiny App is part of the project for the Coursera Developing Data Products course from John Hopkins University.

The App uses the Titanic dataset which includes various attributes for the passengers on this ill-fated voyage including whether a person survived or not. This dataset can be downloaded from [Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dvd940/Developing.Data.Products/master/ShinyApp/data/titanic-all.csv).

The App can be used to explore the data or to predict the probability of survival given some parameters. 

## Using this Shiny App

### Explore Tab

The **Explore** tab can be used to visualize the Titanic dataset. 

Use the inputs and sliders on the left hand panel to change the data being visualized.  

## Predict Tab

The **Predict** tab can be used to visualize the Titanic data set. Enter the attributes of the passenger on the left hand panel and read the probability that this person would have survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. (This prediction model has an accuracy of approximately 0.77. Not great, but OK for demonstration purposes for this project).

## Data Tab

The **Data** tab shows the data from the Titanic dataset in table format.
